			The Lal Mahal (Red Palace) of Pune is one of the most famous monuments located in Pune. In the year 1630 AD, Chhatrapati Shivaji’s Father Shri Shahaji Bhosale, established the Lal Mahal for his wife Jijabai and son. Chhatrapati Shivaji  Maharaj stayed here for several years until he captured his first fort.The original Lal Mahal fell into ruins and the current Lal Mahal is a reconstruction of the original and located in the center of the Pune city. Historically, the Lal Mahal is famous for an encounter between Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and Shaista Khan where Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj cut off the later’s fingers when he was trying to escape from the window of the Lal Mahal.
